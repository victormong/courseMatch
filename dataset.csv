Learn the basics of Android and Java programming, and take the first step on your journey to becoming an Android developer! 

This course is designed for students who are new to programming, and want to learn how to build Android apps. You don’t need any programming experience to take this course. If you’ve been using a smartphone to surf the web and chat with friends, then you’re our perfect target student! 

Learning anything new can be tough. We will walk you through the process of making Android apps, but to get the most out of this course, you must bring your enthusiasm for learning, and budget time on your calendar to learn with us.

By the end of the course, you’ll build two simple (but powerful) apps that you can share with your friends. We also hope that you will learn enough through this course to decide how best to continue your journey as an Android app developer, if you're interesting in pursuing such a path.","If you are new to programming and don’t know where to start, then this is the course for you! 

We will use Android Studio to build our apps, so you should have access to a computer that can run Android Studio in order to follow along (see Android Studio's <a href=""https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Requirements"" target=""_blank"">System Requirements</a> for details). Don’t worry, **you do not need to install Android Studio in advance** -- we will provide detailed installation instructions as part of the course. 

Access to an Android device is helpful, but not at all required.

Now, in case you have some programming experience, parts of this course may be too slow for you — you should feel free to skip those sections.

Finally, the **most important prerequisite** is a willingness to learn new things, and belief that you can do this!",

The following are versions of this question that we came across recently:

 - How can I add radio buttons to my app?
 -  How can I play a sound?
 - How can I navigate between multiple screens? 

This course is a collection of such questions and their answers. 

By the end of this course you will have mastered the ability to implement new Android features by reading a blog or article — this is a critical skill possessed by professional Android developers. As a result, you will also be able to use several User Interface components — like Toggle Buttons, Menus, Grid View and many more —  that are central to making functional and delightful Android apps.","You will need to know the very basics of Android programming (Java) to be successful in this course.

Furthermore, a graphic can be created in considerably fewer lines of code using dimple.js as opposed to d3.js.

So why should you learn d3.js?

Data Driven Documents (d3.js) allows you to build highly customized graphics. If you would like to gain more technical skills and learn more about Javascript and open web standards, then you should complete Lesson 3 and Lesson 4 in order to prepare for the final project.


If you would like to complete the final project using d3.js, you should have some experience reading and using documentation.
