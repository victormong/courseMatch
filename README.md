# courseMatch
A courseMatch is a web application which lets online learners find courses and recommends courses for users based on users' ratings.
It uses Coursera API and udacity API to find courses information that the user may be interested in. The application allows the user to search for a particular course and it lists three types of courses based on the level of expertise required for the course - Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced.

The application also recommends courses for users with the help of the ratings provided by the user if the he/she has already taken that course. Collaborative filtering is employed to find the similiarty between courses and is then used to render recommendations for the end user.
